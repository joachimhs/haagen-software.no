About Haagen Software
=====================

The primary goal of the company is to build truly open source software with a clear goal to release 100% of the written software under an Open Source Initiative license. 

In addition to providing consultancy services, Haagen Software AS will focus on the development of the open source projects listed on this page.

Haagen Software AS was registered on the 19th of May 2012 in the Norwegian Brønnøysundregistrene, but the official start date of the company is set to 1st of August 2012. 

EurekaJ
-------

EurekaJ, an Open Source Application Monitoring tool, will be the main focus of development and will move the code base for EurekaJ towards a scalable and easy to install software package for your application monitoring requirements. In addition to the _install and run yourself_ version the exists of EurekaJ today, Haagen Software will focus on building an affordable hosted solution for customers that do not want to operate and host their own private installations. Read more about the current state of EurekaJ on the projects website: [http://eurekaj.haagen.name](http://eurekaj.haagen.name).

BTrace
------

The founder of Haagen Software AS, Joachim Haagen Skeie, is a commiter to the BTrace project. BTrace is a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform, and can be used to pass tracing data to EurekaJ. Haagen Software aims to continue contributing features and functionality to the [BTrace project](http://kenai.com/projects/btrace).

JSFlot
------

The JSFlot JSF chart library builds on top of the JavaScript Open Source Project Flotr (a javascript plotting library based on the Prototype Javascript Framework) to create stunning interactive charts purely using JavaScript?. The JSFlot charting library is simple to install, easy to configure and easy to use in your custom application. All of the applications dependencies (purely JavaScript? related) are included in the Jar file.

The goal of the JSFlot project is to support all the main features of Flotr, while remaining easy and simple to install and use. Read more on the [JSFlot Project page](http://code.google.com/p/jsflot/)

JWireReplay
-----------

JWireReplay will parse the .pcap file format (created with tcpdump), analyze each and every TCP/IP packet within that captured file, organize each full HTTP request according to a specified sessionID (jsessionid for Java apps). After a .pcap file is imported JWireReplay will be able to replay that exact TCP/IP traffic to a specifies remote host. JWireReplay will also be able to play back the imported packets faster than originally captures. 

The objective is to both be able to analyze tough and hidden bugs that appear in your production environment, as well as being able to replay that same traffic to a test environment both for further analysis and for verifying that the bug has been successfully squashed. It is also possible to load-test your test environment using *Real HTTP traffic as captured from your production environment* in a reliable, repeatable manner. 

The project is currently in very early alpha.
