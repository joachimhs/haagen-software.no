Open Source Statement
=====================

The openness of Haagen Software is founded on the belief that Open Source makes good business sense. Writing good software is one aspect of operating a viable company, hosting that software to operate great services is another. You should be able to get the best of both, something Haagen Software will strive to deliver. If you're not happy with the services provided we genuinely would like you to have the option to either host the software yourself or find someone else that is able to meet your requirements.

Haagen Software AS is committed to building truly open software with a clear goal to publish 100% of the source code written available under an open source license, developed in the open for anyone interested in viewing, using, altering or enhancing the source code.

In the open source world, the type of license is Alpha-Omega. While Haagen Software recognize the "keep it open" nature of copyleft licenses (like the [GPL license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)), Haagen Software will strive to publish under a permissive license where possible, preferably using the [MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) or the [Apache 2 license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_2_License). Contributing back to the original software should, in our opinion be your choice. After all you are the one who best knows your business and how to run it!

GitHub will be the primary outlet where the source code will be hosted as that is where our projects will most likely meet developers interested in reading and/or contributing to the source code. That said, some of the projects Haagen Software contributes to lives elsewhere, like Project Kenai or Google Code.
