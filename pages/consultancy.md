Consultancy
===========

The preferred consultancy model is based on agile principles, and is either iteration-based or hour-based. The general principle behind these contracts is a statement that Haagen Software wishes to deliver the best software possible within the constraints of the project being worked on. If you, for any reason, are not happy with the delivered work, you are free to cancel the contract and go elsewhere.

Consultancy fees start from USD 150 (NOK 900) excluding taxes and government fees.

Iteration based contract
------------------------

The object of this approach is to spread the risk evenly between the parties involved. One iteration will last for a predefined period of time up to no more than *four* weeks. Each iteration will follow following process:

- Before the start of the very first iteration, a non-refundable deposit payment for half of the first iteration is required. This deposit can be defined as the customers financial risk. This deposit will be credited towards the first payment for the deliverables for the first iteration.
- At the end of each iteration the customer will sign off on the deliverables to ensure that the quality delivered meets the requirements agreed upon for each deliverable.
- After each iteration an invoice will be issued, due within 14 days after the iteration is delivered.
- If, for any reason, you are not happy with work delivered from Haagen Software, you are free to cancel the rest of the contract.
- Upon payment the copyright to the source code, documentation or any other deliverables belong to the customer, unless otherwise agreed upon.
- If payment is not received within 14 days, Haagen Software reserves the right to delay any futher work until payment is received without any financial liability. If payment is not recieved within 30 days Haagen Software is free to cancel the rest of the contract without any financial liability.

Hour based contract
-------------------

In an hour based contract the customer agrees to pay a fixed amount for every hour of work performed by Haagen Software.

- Haagen Software will invoice the customer on fixed predefined intervals due within 14 days.
- Upon payment the copyright to source code, documentation or other deliverables belong to the customer, unless otherwise agreed upon.
- At any time, for any reason, the customer is free to cancel the agreement. Haagen Software will at that time issue an invoice including any outstanding charges, due within 14 days.
- If payment is not received within 14 days, Haagen Software reserves the right to delay any futher work until payment is received without any financial liability. If payment is not recieved within 30 days Haagen Software is free to cancel the rest of the contract without any financial liability.
