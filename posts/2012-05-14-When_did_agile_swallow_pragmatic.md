When did Agile Swallow Pragmatic ?
==================================

_Disclaimer: This article is an adaptation from a lightning talk I gave at the Norwegian Agile conference on November 14th of 2011._

Agile is no longer a buzzword. The Agile train have arrived and it has taken over from it waterfall cousin. It has been more than a decade since the “Agile Manifesto” arrived and it seems that Agile now is the be all and end all of Software Development. 

As I graduated from Queensland University of Technology in 2006, I started my IT career just after the “Agile revolution”, and as such have never worked on a waterfall project. The waterfall model was definitely part of my curriculum at university, but the subject was taught in a way that gave a sense that this model and its heavy requirements on documentation, up-front work and strict sign-offs might not be the best model for organizing IT projects. 

My question, though, is simply this: When did Agile grow into a behemoth that swallowed the ability to be pragmatic in an Agile Team? I am basing this article on observations through my own work in Agile teams and organizations, as well as on conversations I have had with other developers and “agilers”. The pith is simple: How can we put Agility back into Agile? 

The paradox might be the same as it has always been. And the issues raised here might be the same issues that have always haunted IT projects, and I will try to give a historical reference where appropriate. 

During my university years I had a lecturer that made us memorize the following quote: 

	“The primary tool available to [the Project Manager] is the brainpower of men who are professional 	specialists in diverse fields”

There is a lot of wisdom and there is a clear sense of an underlying message of the respect and trust that needs to be involved in order to lead a successful IT project. One of the most interesting facts about this quote, which was written by Professor Paul O. Gaddis in the paper “The Project Manager”, is that it was published way back in 1956. This goes a long way to suggest that the underlying values in Agile didn’t in fact spring to life along with the Agile Manifesto. 

To me, Agile is all about four values: The ability to adapt to change, empowerment, autonomy and self-organization. I strongly believe that these four values, which represents an underlying organizational culture, are more important for success than all of the Agile processes combined. The Tweeter “Wisdomalive” summarized this clearly and concisely: 

	“What’s required by your schedule may get done, but what’s driven by your passion will be completed”

Richard Murch suggests in his book “Project Management: Best practices for IT Professionals” that: 

	“Statistically, most projects fail because the ‘soft science’ portions of the project have not received enough attention – the human factor has not been adequately addressed” 

The Agile Organization
----------------------

Most organizations have structured their employees in a hierarchical structure, grouped in departments that usually do not resemble the products that the organization delivers to its customers. More often than not we will encounter departments with names like “development”, “operations”, “customer support”, and so on. These departments are created on the basis that it might be beneficial to group people working on similar tasks. This might be a valid point, but there also needs to be a cross-departmental responsibility to be able to deliver what the customer requires from the organization as a whole. 

The main issue I have with these department divides is that they work as a very effective barrier between people that would otherwise rely on each other to be able to do the best job possible. Suddenly, metrics that measure the amount of work being generated from one department to another appears. This, of course, leads to organizational changes that involve strengthening the divide through a formal “inter-department communication” process. Once these artificial barriers between departments and people starts to emerge, it will undoubtedly make inhibit the core values of Agile – Empowerment, team self-organization and autonomy. In turn this will adversely affect any teams ability to adapt to change. 

Mini-organizations will start to emerge within these departments, with the result that a multitude of rules, standardized tools and culture will exist within the organization an as these rules and standardizations becomes more and more strict, creativity will start to be affected. It is very hard to be creative within an organization that have adopted a “standard process” for most of the tasks performed, an its not only killing creativity – its also affecting the organizations ability to adapt to change.  

William McKnight, Chairman of the board at 3M from 1949 to 1966, encouraged management to delegate responsibility and encourage men and women to exercise their initiative.  There are many quotes that I could use from McKnight, but I think the following two speaks volumes to his corporate culture: 

	“If you put fences around people, you get sheep. Give people the room they need”

	“Hire good people, and leave them alone”

Needless to say, McKnights guiding principles are still at the foundation of 3M (according to Wikipedia).

Whats wrong with Agile then ? 
-----------------------------

At this point in the article, you might be asking yourself this question. My biggest concern about the Agile movement is the fact that it has become more about the process and less about the people. I’ve read countless articles on Agile Software Development where the main focus is on “Agile the process”, a process that is described in detail about how a software team can deliver in short iterations, about how to employ and enforce TDD (Test Driven Development), how to structure your CI (Continuous Integration), how to build up a Functional-Testing strategy, and how to achieve Continuous Deployment. 

There is nothing inherently bad about these articles, they are all valid and important aspects of any Agile software organization, and they are all important tools that can be used in order to quickly be able to adapt to changes. But to me, even though they are important building blocks and tools that will help your organization adapt and employ Agile, they are not at the heart of Agile.  

Combining the departmentalizing of the organization with a heavy reliance on the tools and processes of Agile will not make your organization Agile. It is just not that simple. It might look Agile on paper, but it most definitely will not feel Agile to the people involved. 

The path towards a true Agile organization is more about a cultural change throughout the organization, than it is adapting and using a few new tools and processes. Agile is just that: a complete organizational and cultural change that will encompass all of the departments throughout the organization. It becomes less about how the “Development” department is going to employ Agile methodologies to deliver a higher quality product faster and more about how the organization can break down the barriers between departments, systems, strategies and rank. It is about everyone involved in the organization being empowered and enabled to do his or her best. It is about the autonomy that comes with mutual respect and trust between employees, about relying less on schedules and more on peoples strengths and passion, and finally it is knowing that the agility in the organization is built in from the ground up, encompassing the whole organization, from the “factory-floor” to the CEO. 

Every once in a while you read reports from organizations that have truly got it. For instance, go read the document describing how they work at Valve, or have a look at one of the many available presentations on how they are organized at GitHub. We tend to automatically think that we need to safeguard our organization in such a way that the employees aren't able to "waste" corporate time. But I believe its the other way around. Fencing in your employees and reducing their creative freedom will reduce the chances that your company produce great products. 

Summary
-------
I want to leave with a final though, which I think summarize this article in a nice and concise manner. Building on from the quote from Paul Gaddis at the start of this article, I would like to propose the following: 

	“As a member of an Agile organization, your most important asset is the people working with you, on your team, who are experts in their own field of work”

I do honestly believe that if an organizations culture had this as its foundation, the agility we all seek would come along by itself.
